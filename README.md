This is my final project for ST 445 - Statistical Computing and Data Management, written in SAS 9.4. The input data sets are from the 2023 EPA
TRI report and detail incidents of industrial pollution. The program imports, cleans, and combines the three data sets, then produces a 14-page
report with numeric summaries, frequency statistics, charts, graphs, and traffic-lit reports. The project is split accross two files:

FP01:
This one imports, cleans, and merges the data sets, then synthesizes new variables.

FP02:
This one produces the report from the data set generated by FP01.

Note: This class required very sparce, concise comments, which is not how I normally choose to comment my code.
